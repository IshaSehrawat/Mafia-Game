# Mafia-Game
A command line interface for the famous game "Mafia". It is single user. It prompts the user to tell the number of players in the game and allows the user to choose their character or randomly assigns the character for the user. If the user is voted out or killed by a mafia, the game simulates on its own.
The code is entirely based on implementing the game using Object Oriented programming (OOP).
